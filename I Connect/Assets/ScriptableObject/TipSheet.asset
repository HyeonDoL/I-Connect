  - TipText: "In communication networks, a NODE is either a redistribution point or
      a communication endpoint.  A physical network node is an active electronic device
      that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting
      information over a communications channel.\r"

      networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the\_Internet.
      A data packet is typically\_forwarded\_from one router to another router through
      the networks that constitute an\_internetwork\_until it reaches its destination\_node.\r\n"

  - TipText: "In the late 1950s, early networks of computers included the military
      radar system Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE).\r\nIn 1959, Anatolii
      Ivanovich Kitov proposed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
      the Soviet Union a detailed plan for the re-organisation of the control of the
      Soviet armed forces and of the Soviet economy on the basis of a network of computing
      centres.\r\n"

  - TipText: "In 1960, the commercial airline reservation system semi-automatic business
      research environment (SABRE) went online with two connected mainframes.\r\nIn
      1962, J.C.R. Licklider developed a working group he called the \"Intergalactic
      Computer Network\", a precursor to the ARPANET, at the Advanced Research Projects
      Agency (ARPA).\r\nIn 1964, researchers at Dartmouth College developed the Dartmouth
      Time Sharing System for distributed users of large computer systems. The same
      year, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a research group supported by
      General Electric and Bell Labs used a computer to route and manage telephone
      connections.\r\n"

      area network (WAN). This was an immediate precursor to the ARPANET, of which
      Roberts became program manager.\r\nAlso in 1965, Western Electric introduced
      the first widely used telephone switch that implemented true computer control.\r\nIn
      1969, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute,
      the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah became
      connected as the beginning of the ARPANET network using 50 kbit/s circuits.\r\nIn
      1972, commercial services using X.25 were deployed, and later used as an underlying
      infrastructure for expanding TCP/IP networks.\r\n"

      Ethernet, a networking system that was based on the Aloha network, developed
      in the 1960s by Norman Abramson and colleagues at the University of Hawaii.
      In July 1976, Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs published their paper \"Ethernet:
      Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks\" and collaborated
      on several patents received in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, Robert Metcalfe pursued
      making Ethernet an open standard.\r\n"
